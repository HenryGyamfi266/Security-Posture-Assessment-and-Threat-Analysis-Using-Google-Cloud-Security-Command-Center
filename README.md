# Security-Posture-Assessment-and-Threat-Analysis-Using-Google-Cloud-Security-Command-Center
## Overview
In this project, I will explore Google Cloud's Security Command Center (SCC) to monitor and secure cloud environments. 
SCC helps identify security misconfigurations, report active threats, and remediate vulnerabilities across Google Cloud resources. 
Key tasks include setting up a continuous export pipeline using Pub/Sub and analyzing SCC findings with BigQuery. 

## Scenario
Cymbal Bank, a major American retail bank with over 2,000 branches and $24 billion in revenue, is working on modernizing its security approach as part of its digital transformation. 
Originally founded in 1920 and acquired by Cymbal Group in 1975, the bank serves customers both in-branch and digitally through an app launched in 2014. 
Now, Cymbal Bank aims to integrate a centralized security platform to strengthen threat monitoring and vulnerability management across its Google Cloud resources. 
As a Cloud Security Engineer, your role is to explore Google Cloud’s Security Command Center features, focusing on export and analytics capabilities,
to prepare a presentation for the CTO on its advantages for Cymbal’s security operations.
